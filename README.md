# Zephyrus Engineering Website

## Overview
This project is a responsive website for Zephyrus Engineering Limited, showcasing information about the company, projects, and a contact form. It includes a dark mode feature for enhanced user experience.

## Approach
- **HTML**: Used semantic HTML for better accessibility and structure.
- **CSS**: Implemented custom styles for layout, responsiveness, and a dark mode theme.
- **JavaScript**: Enabled dynamic features like the dark mode toggle.
- **Mobile First Design**: Ensured the website is fully responsive, prioritizing smaller screens.

## Libraries or Frameworks Used
- No external libraries or frameworks were used; all styles and scripts are custom-built.

## Dark Mode Issue and Solution
Initially, the dark mode styles for sections were not applying due to missing or incorrect class toggling. This was resolved by ensuring:
1. The `dark-mode` class is applied to the `body` element.
2. Specific styles in CSS target elements inside `.dark-mode`.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [<repository_url>](https://github.com/AmineGaf/Zephyrus-task1.git)
